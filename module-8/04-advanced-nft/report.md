# Gas Cost Analysis Report

## Overview
This report compares the gas efficiency of bitmap and mapping implementations for NFT contracts. Two main patterns were analyzed:
1. Direct whitelist claims (using AdvancedNFT contract)
2. Commit-reveal pattern (using CommitRevealMapping and CommitRevealBitmap contracts)

## Methodology
All tests were performed with 5 users to ensure consistent comparison. Gas costs were measured for each user interaction and averaged.

## Results

### 1. Direct Whitelist Claims

| Implementation | Average Gas | 
|----------------|-------------|
| Bitmap         | 160778     |
| Mapping        | 174382     |
| Difference     | 13604 gas (7%) |

**Most Efficient Implementation:** Bitmap

### 2. Commit-Reveal Pattern

#### Commit Phase

| Implementation | Average Gas |
|----------------|-------------|
| Bitmap         | 86226.6 |
| Mapping        | 99914.6 |
| Difference     | 13688 gas (13.70%) |

**Most Efficient Implementation:** Bitmap

#### Reveal Phase

| Implementation | Average Gas |
|----------------|-------------|
| Bitmap         | 212587 |
| Mapping        | 212609 |
| Difference     | 22 gas (0.01%) |

**Most Efficient Implementation:** Bitmap (marginally)

## Analysis

### Direct Whitelist Claims
For direct whitelist claims, the bitmap implementation is more gas efficient than the mapping implementation by approximately 13604 gas (7%). This efficiency comes from the bitmap's compact storage representation, which requires less storage when dealing with a large number of boolean flags.

### Commit-Reveal Pattern
For the commit-reveal pattern, the results show:

1. **Commit Phase**: The Bitmap implementation is significantly more efficient, saving approximately 13688 gas (13.70%).
2. **Reveal Phase**: The difference is minimal (0.01%), with the Bitmap implementation being marginally more efficient.

## Conclusion

The choice between bitmap and mapping implementations depends on the specific use case:

1. For simple whitelisting with direct claims, the **bitmap** implementation is more gas-efficient.

2. For commit-reveal patterns:
   - Commit phase shows the **Bitmap** implementation is significantly more efficient
   - Reveal phase shows minimal difference between implementations (slight advantage to Bitmap)

## Recommendations

1. For projects primarily focused on direct claiming from whitelists, use the **bitmap** implementation.
2. For projects using commit-reveal patterns, use the **Bitmap** implementation as it provides significant gas savings during the commit phase while maintaining comparable efficiency in the reveal phase.
3. For comprehensive projects that may use both patterns, the **bitmap** implementation is more cost-effective overall.

## Interesting Observation

It's noteworthy that the bitmap implementation is consistently more efficient than the mapping implementation across different operations. This reinforces the conventional wisdom that bitmap-based storage is generally more gas-efficient for representing sets of boolean values. Unlike our previous results, which showed mixed efficiency between implementations, our more recent tests demonstrate the bitmap implementation's superiority in gas efficiency. This highlights the importance of thorough testing under realistic conditions before making implementation decisions in production environments.
