Compilation of things I've learned during that module.

The linter issues in the `generated/` folder are:
1. Expected, TheGraph's code generator doesn't follow all linting rules
2. Harmless, won't affect your subgraph's functionality
3. Not fixable by you (the dev), these files are auto-generated
4. Should be ignored, focus on your own code in `src/`
