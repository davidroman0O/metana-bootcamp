     * VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Attack via Flash Loan Callback
     * 
     * The SideEntranceLenderPool allows users to take flash loans and tracks user balances
     * for deposits/withdrawals. The critical flaw is that during the flash loan execution,
     * the borrower can call back into the pool and deposit the borrowed funds, creating
     * a balance that can be withdrawn after the flash loan completes.
     * 
     * HOW TO IDENTIFY THIS VULNERABILITY:
     * 1. Look for flash loan implementations that allow arbitrary external calls
     * 2. Check if the contract tracks internal balances separately from ETH balance
     * 3. Identify if users can interact with the contract during flash loan execution
     * 4. Look for missing reentrancy guards on state-changing functions
     * 5. Check if flash loan validation only verifies ETH balance, not accounting
     * 
     * KEY VULNERABILITY PATTERN:
     * ```solidity
     * function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
     *     uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
     *     
     *     // Sends ETH and allows arbitrary execution
     *     IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();
     *     
     *     // Only checks ETH balance, not internal accounting!
     *     require(address(this).balance >= balanceBefore, "Flash loan not paid back");
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ATTACK FLOW:
     * 1. Attacker requests flash loan for entire pool balance (1000 ETH)
     * 2. Pool sends 1000 ETH to attacker and calls execute()
     * 3. In execute(), attacker deposits the 1000 ETH back to the pool
     * 4. This credits the attacker's balance in the pool's mapping
     * 5. Flash loan check passes (ETH balance unchanged)
     * 6. Attacker withdraws their "deposited" balance, draining the pool
     * 
     * IMPACT:
     * - Complete theft of all funds in the pool (1000 ETH)
     * - Pool is left with 0 balance
     * - All user deposits are stolen

         * THE EXPLOIT MECHANISM:
         * 
         * The SideEntranceAttacker contract implements the attack:
         * 
         * 1. attack() function:
         *    - Gets pool balance (1000 ETH)
         *    - Calls pool.flashLoan(1000 ETH)
         * 
         * 2. execute() callback (called by pool during flash loan):
         *    - Receives 1000 ETH from the pool
         *    - Immediately calls pool.deposit{value: 1000 ETH}()
         *    - This credits attacker contract with 1000 ETH balance in the pool
         * 
         * 3. Flash loan validation in pool:
         *    - Checks: address(this).balance >= balanceBefore âœ“
         *    - Pool balance is unchanged (1000 ETH went out, 1000 ETH came back)
         *    - Flash loan succeeds!
         * 
         * 4. Back in attack() function:
         *    - Calls pool.withdraw() to get the 1000 ETH balance
         *    - Transfers ETH to the attacker EOA
         * 
         * CRITICAL INSIGHT:
         * The pool only validates that its ETH balance hasn't decreased during the
         * flash loan. It doesn't check that the internal accounting (balances mapping)
         * hasn't been manipulated. This allows the attacker to "convert" the flash
         * loan into a legitimate balance.
         * 
         * PREVENTION:
         * - Use reentrancy guards (OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard)
         * - Implement a "flash loan in progress" flag
         * - Prevent deposits/withdrawals during flash loan execution
         * - Track borrowed amounts separately from user balances
         * - Follow check-effects-interactions pattern
