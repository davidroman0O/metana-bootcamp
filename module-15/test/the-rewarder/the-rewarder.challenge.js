     * VULNERABILITY: Flash Loan Snapshot Manipulation for Reward Gaming
     * 
     * The RewarderPool distributes rewards based on the user's token balance at the moment of
     * deposit/withdrawal. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can use flash loans to
     * temporarily inflate their balance, claim disproportionate rewards, and return the funds.
     * 
     * HOW TO IDENTIFY THIS VULNERABILITY:
     * 1. Look for reward systems based on instantaneous balance snapshots
     * 2. Check if rewards can be claimed immediately after deposits
     * 3. Identify missing time-weighted average balance calculations
     * 4. Look for reward pools vulnerable to flash loan manipulation
     * 5. Check if there's a minimum staking period before reward eligibility
     * 
     * KEY VULNERABILITY PATTERN:
     * - Rewards are distributed based on current balance: balanceOf(msg.sender)
     * - No time component in reward calculation
     * - Snapshot taken at deposit/withdrawal time
     * - Flash loans allow massive temporary balances at zero cost
     * 
     * ATTACK SCENARIO:
     * 1. Wait for new reward round (5 days since last round)
     * 2. Take flash loan for massive amount (1M tokens)
     * 3. Deposit to trigger reward snapshot with huge balance
     * 4. Claim rewards based on inflated balance
     * 5. Withdraw immediately
     * 6. Repay flash loan
     * 7. Keep the rewards (nearly 100% of the round's rewards)
     * 
     * IMPACT:
     * - Legitimate stakers get minimal rewards (4 users get ~0% instead of 25% each)
     * - Attacker claims ~100% of rewards with zero capital at risk
     * - Breaks the fairness of the reward distribution system

         * THE EXPLOIT MECHANISM:
         * 
         * Looking at TheRewarderPool contract:
         * - distributeRewards() is called on deposit/withdraw
         * - It checks if 5 days have passed for a new round
         * - Rewards are calculated based on current accToken balance
         * - accToken is minted 1:1 with liquidityToken deposits
         * 
         * The Attack Flow:
         * 1. Advance time 5 days to enable new reward round
         * 2. Take flash loan of 1,000,000 tokens (entire pool)
         * 3. In flash loan callback:
         *    a. Approve rewarder pool to spend tokens
         *    b. Deposit 1M tokens -> get 1M accTokens
         *    c. This triggers distributeRewards() for round 3
         *    d. Snapshot: attacker has 1M, others have 100 each
         *    e. Attacker gets: 1M / (1M + 400) â‰ˆ 99.96% of rewards
         *    f. Withdraw 1M tokens immediately
         *    g. Repay flash loan
         * 4. Transfer reward tokens to attacker EOA
         * 
         * CRITICAL INSIGHT:
         * The reward calculation uses the balance AT THE MOMENT of the transaction.
         * Flash loans allow us to have a massive balance for just that moment,
         * gaming the snapshot mechanism.

         * - Use time-weighted average balances (aka track balance * time)
         * - Implement minimum staking periods before reward eligibility
         * - Add withdrawal delays or vesting periods for rewards
         * - Use commit-reveal schemes for reward distribution (eventually)
         * - Consider using Chainlink VRF for random snapshot times (or any other good oracle)
         * - Implement timelocks between deposit and first reward claim
         * - Use merkle trees for periodic reward distributions (a snapshot and tadam)
